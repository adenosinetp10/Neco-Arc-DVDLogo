## Hotkeys

Press `S`

## Build Yourself
### Ubuntu
Must have g++.

  ```sudo apt install libsfml-dev```
  
  ```sudo apt install make```
  
 Go into the root project directory. 
 Then do 
 
 ```make```
 
 that's all.
 
 ### Windows
 
 I don't know, maybe use Visual Studio and include all the sfml `include`, `lib` and `bin` in the project directory and configure the soulution settings to set dependencies.
